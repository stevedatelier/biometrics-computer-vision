# Biometric Authentication of Cattle

### Abstract

Some time ago I came to the painful realization that much of what we perceive about ranching is wrong. Who am I? I am a scientist and professional designer who with a co-authored invention helps you reimagine the farming experience. Why don’t we see biotech products invade that market? According to this paper, this can happen. It’s a world set in motion by new prototypes of AI systems now flocking the startup ecosystem. In this thesis paper, I will present one of the most exciting technologies, in my opinion, to be used by farmers all over the world, from simple muzzle-print features matching devices to advanced computer-aided techniques and the principles built into it. Using biometrics in ranching is a game-changing perspective that will open a new world of possibilities.
